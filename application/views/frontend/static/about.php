                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Ziptask was founded in 2010 by Shawn Livermore, a software architect and an author of multiple software development books. Shawn was managing remote development teams, and recognized the need for a refined platform for outsourcing. None of the tools in existence really made sense or fully met the needs of the market, so he decided to build one.</p>
                    <p>In March of 2011, Jeff Sherwood, a branding and marketing expert, joined forces to help brand the platform and bring Ziptask to market.</p>
                    <p>In April of 2012, Stan Miroshnik, a corporate finance executive joined the team, and led an angel investment round to gain traction.</p>
                    <p>In December of 2012, Ziptask was accepted into TechStars Cloud, an accelerator program, and has since refined and relaunched it's core offering. </p>

                    <h2>What Drives Us</h2>
                    <p>Hiring virtual/remote freelancers online is tricky, risky, and can be a painful process. After hundreds of interviews with customers, the essential need that continues to surface is <b>project oversight</b> by cloud-based project managers that have the seasoned and experienced backgrounds specific to the types of work being performed. This oversight consists of guidance in the initial project setup process, (finding, hiring, and positioning the team, then clarifying and validating the project requirements and materials), as well as the daily management of the freelancers as the project moves forward.
                    <p>Ziptask is committed to providing a seamless work management system that solves the core challenges of finding, hiring, and managing freelancers. </p>
