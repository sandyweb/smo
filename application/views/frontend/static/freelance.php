                <p>I have made over $4,000 USD as a freealancer on the Ziptask platform, creating SquareSpace sites.
                    This system is fine-tuned for what makes sense to both a customer and a freelancer, and I am excited to be on the platform.</p>

                <h2>Become An Affiliate</h2>
                <p>Earn 7% on every job your website or blog refers into our system!
                    This is completely separate from the freelancer work process,
                    and means you can earn without lifting a finger on the projects you refer.
                    Ziptask is a fully managed work platform with
                    experienced project managers who will guide customers through their projects,
                    oversee freelancers, and ensure high quality work every time.
                    This means typically that customers come to us with larger-than-normal pieces of work,
                    and so that would allow you to earn a higher commission as a result.</p>

                <p class="affiliate-subtext">Ziptask pays its affiliates 7% of the total project amount. This is standard for any project, large or small.</p>
                <div class="clear"></div>
                <p>The average transaction size for us is approximately $500-1000 dollars on the first use, and over $2000 on subsequent uses as clients get more comfortable with the service. Again, we will give credit to our affiliates for all jobs performed by the clients they refer. </p>
