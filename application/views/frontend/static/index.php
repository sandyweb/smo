        <p>Ziptask charges customers 3% as a transactional fee. This is standard for any project, large or small, simple or complex. Ziptask saves you time and money, and ensures a dramatically higher level of quality for the work being performed. In most cases, the costs of using ziptask with its project management layer approach will save 20-40% in terms of time and budget, even with the additional expense of having a project manager involved. This is because it reduces the chance for wasted effort and lost time due to mistakes in the communication, documentation, process, or approach.</p>

            <p>Getting your website built or your software developed can be tedious, messy, and riddled with challenges. This becomes even more of an issue when you consider all of the time zone and language barriers that may exist when dealing with freelancers online. Enter the project manager. Ziptask oversight personnel serve a critical role in the lifespan of a project, by using time-proven methodologies and state-of-the-art tools to control and guide the project from its inception, to the final deliverable. </p>
            <br />
            <p>The Harvard Business Review published a revealing study that analyzed 1,471 software and technology projects, and found that the average overrun on time and budget was 27%, but even worse was that 1 out of 6 went over budget by 200%, and missed the schedule deadlines by nearly 70%!</p>
            <br />
            <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers also performed a similar study, of 10,640 projects from over 200 companies in 30 countries & across numerous industries. Their study showed that only a low 2.5% of the companies surveyed successfully completed all of their projects. </p>
            <br />
            <p>Project oversight is critical to delivering a successful end result, and the Ziptask platform is designed with oversight intrinsic to the process.</p>
