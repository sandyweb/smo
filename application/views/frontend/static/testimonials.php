                    <p>Ziptask is awesome. It simplifies the outsourcing process to something more manageable and predictable. I love the service, love the dashboard online tools, and would never go back to the old way of doing things.</p>

                    <p>Ziptask is an operational masterpiece. They somehow found a way to put together a mixture of Basecamp and ODesk into a seamless experience. I'm sold.</p>

                    <p>This is a game-changer for my companies. We sent in Excel Macro development work, and without extending hardly any effort, we stood by and watched a sophisticated project management-driven arrangement take place. Hard to ever go back to personally babysitting the freelancers again.</p>

                    <p>Ziptask has figured out how to make outsourcing work as easy as checking email or posting on a blog. It's making my consulting workflow as streamlined as humanly possible. Love it. Will continue to use it. </p>
